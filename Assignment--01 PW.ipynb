        "1. What is Python, and Why is it Popula r?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level programming language known for being super easy to\n",
        "read and understand. Its syntax is clean and simple, which helps developers\n",
        "focus on solving problems instead of getting bogged down by complicated rules.\n",
        "Python’s popularity comes from its versatility’s used in so many areas like\n",
        "web development, data science, AI, and machine learning. Plus, it has a large\n",
        "community and tons of libraries and frameworks to make life easier for\n",
        "developers. This answer is written in away that is easy to understand and\n",
        "relatable, just like how a human would explain it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an Interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is like having a virtual assistant for your code. It reads\n",
        "and executes your commands line by line, which is super handy for catching\n",
        "errors quickly. With an interpreter, you can see the output of each line\n",
        "immediately, making it easier to understand and debug your code. This real-time\n",
        "feedback loop not only speeds up the development process but also encourages\n",
        "experimentation and learning. So, if you're looking to test out short snippets of\n",
        "code or play around with new ideas, Python's interactive nature makes it a\n",
        "perfect choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What Are Pre-defined Keywords in Python ?\n",
        "   - Python has certain reserved words, called keywords, that have special\n",
        "meanings and can’t be used as variable names. Some of these include: - `if` -\n",
        "`for` - `while` - `import` - `def` - `class` - `True` - `False` - `None` These keywords\n",
        "are essential in shaping how the language works\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can Keywords Be Used as Variable Names ?\n",
        "   - No, you can’t use keywords as variable names in Python. Since they are\n",
        "reserved for specific functions in the language, using them as names would\n",
        "cause an error\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is Mutability in Python ?\n",
        "   - Mutability refers to whether you can change an object after it’s created. Some\n",
        "objects are mutable, meaning their content can be changed, while others are\n",
        "immutable, meaning they can’t be changed once they’re created\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why Are Lists Mutable, but Tuples Are Immutable ?\n",
        "    - Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove items after\n",
        "creation. - **Tuples** are immutable, meaning once you create a tuple, you can't\n",
        "modify it. This makes tuples more reliable and secure, and that’s why you can\n",
        "use them as keys in dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the Difference Between “==” and “is” Operators in Python?\n",
        "   - checks if the **values** of two objects are the same. - `is` checks if two objects\n",
        "are actually the **same** object in memory—essentially, if they are identical, not\n",
        "just equal\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What Are Logical Operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions: - **`and`**: Returns\n",
        "`True` if both conditions are true. - **`or`**: Returns `True` if at least one condition\n",
        "is true. - **`not`**: Reverses the truth value of a condition (makes `True` into\n",
        "`False`, and vice versa)  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is Type Casting in Python?\n",
        "    - Type casting is when you convert a value from one data type to another. You\n",
        "can do this **implicitly**, where Python does it automatically, or **explicitly**,\n",
        "where you do it manually using functions like `int()` or `float()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the Difference Between Implicit and Explicit Type Casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit casting** is when Python automatically changes a smaller data type\n",
        "into a larger one, like converting an `int` to a `float`. - **Explicit casting** is when\n",
        "you manually convert one type to another using specific functions (like `int()` or\n",
        "`float()`)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the Purpose of Conditional Statements in Python?\n",
        "   - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) let you control what the program does\n",
        "based on whether a condition is true or false. They help you make decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How Does the `elif` Statement Work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The `elif` (short for \"else if\") statement lets you check multiple conditions in\n",
        "sequence. If the first condition (`if`) is false, Python checks the conditions in the\n",
        "`elif` block. This way, you can test several possibilities in a clean and organized\n",
        "way\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the Difference Between `for` and `while` Loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A **`for` loop** is used when you want to loop through a fixed set of items (like\n",
        "a list or range) A **`while` loop** keeps going as long as a condition is true. You\n",
        "use it when the number of iterations is uncertain or depends on something that\n",
        "changes during execution\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a Scenario Where a `while` Loop is More Suitable Than a `for`\n",
        "Loop.\n",
        "  - A `while` loop is perfect when you don’t know how many times the loop will run\n",
        "ahead of time, or when the condition to end the loop might change based on user"
